Hello!

I'm Henry and I design and develop full-stack applications and modules. I've worked professionally as a front-end developer and have now migrated over to the back-end and full-stack. The migration was a tough process, but so worth it. I love what I'm doing now.

You can check out some of my stuff and what I'm currently working on here at my <data data-icon="ei-sc-github"></data>[Github](https://github.com/HHenry88/).

My old site and hobby projects back in the Angular-only days can be found [here](http://henryhan.me/).
