I ended up choosing this theme because of the simplicity. Simplistic design is best design (In my opinion). I don't have the eye like a professional for design but I know what I like, and I like this. I also like soup for every meal of the day, so what do I know?

Anyways, this blog will have no before-hand organization or planning. It'll just be about a subject that I've had floating around in my head, or a subject I've talked about with someone, or something that I think is worth learning.

I want to talk about the gap between being a beginner that's learning javascript from online resources like [code academy][https://www.codecademy.com/] or [freecodecamp][https://www.freecodecamp.org/], and becoming a confident developer that can contribute to real projects on a team.  -->
