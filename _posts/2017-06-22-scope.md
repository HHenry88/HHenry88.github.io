# So what is scope?

A scope is a section in your program where a name binding is valid. Basically, this means that wherever you declare a variable, you'll be able to use it. If i declare:
```javascript
var x = 20
```
then x is assigned to 20. And I can use that x variable anywhere in that scope and it will be equal to 20.

Simple. Bloody simple. So simple that I'm embarrassed at how long it took me to write up to this point. Now, where can I NOT use it?

Javascript has rules for scopes that we need to keep in mind:
  1. New scopes are created every time we create a new function.
  2. New scopes can be created inside of other scopes. This essentially means that functions can be created inside of functions.
  3. An inner scope has access to bindings that were declared in the outer scope. However the outer scope does NOT have access to the bindings declared in its inner scopes.

### 1. New scopes are created every time we create a new function

Don't over think it. Just: every time a function is made, inside those curly braces is a scope. A scope that is unique to itself.

Let's make a function called animals with a variable x that's assigned to 'rabbit'. And then another function called frisbee, that console logs x. And then we'll invoke frisbee.

```javascript
function animals(){
  //this is the scope of the animals function

  var x = 'rabbit';
}

function frisbee(){
  //this is the scope of the frisbee function

  console.log(x)
}

frisbee();
```
Now, if you're like me when I was learning you're probably thinking, "This is obviously going to console log 'rabbit'. I'm ready to move on.". Try it out here on [repl.it][https://repl.it/J3s6].

So it comes out as <span class="red">Reference Error: x is not defined</span>. Again, looking at rule 1. The animals function makes a new scope. Whatever variables we declare in there, can only be used in that scope. So the frisbee function has no access to the variable that is assigned to 'rabbit'.

Since each have their own scope, declaring variable x in frisbee has no affect on the variable x in animals!

```javascript
function animals(){
  //this is the scope of the animals function

  var x = 'rabbit';
  console.log('animals scope:',x);
}

function frisbee(){
  //this is the scope of the frisbee function

  var x = 'flick hucks';
  console.log('frisbee scope:',x);
}
animals();
frisbee();
```
Try this out on [repl.it][https://repl.it/J3sq] again.

### 2. New scopes can be created inside of other scopes

A scope can be inside another scope. And if we remember from rule 1, scopes are created every time we create a new function. So let's create a scope within a scope:

```javascript
function animals(){
  //this is the scope of the animals function

  function frisbee(){
    //this is the scope of the frisbee function
    var x = 'flick hucks'
  }

  console.log('animals scope:',x);
}

animals();
```

Here's a [repl.it][https://repl.it/J3tK] example of it.  However we get the <span class="red">Reference Error: x is not defined</span> again. This makes sense when we look at rule 3:

### 3. An inner scope has access to bindings that were declared in the outer scope. However the outer scope does NOT have access to the bindings declared in its inner scopes.

#### will finish later


It's actually quite useful and simple, and understanding scope becomes second nature after a little bit.



When I first started learning, I didn't know such a silly rule existed. Why can't I use this variable wherever in my program that I want? Why must javascript try to limit me? Why is there another thing I must learn before I can build Skynet? -->
